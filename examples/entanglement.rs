//! This is a basic example showing how to initialize QuEST environment
//! and perform a operations on a quantum register consisting of 2 qubits.
//!
//! We entangle the qubits by preparing a Bell state `|00> + |11>`.
//! Next, we measure both qubits in the computational basis.  Because qubits are
//! entangled, after the measurement they are both in the same, equally probable
//! state `0` or `1`.
